## Day Off PDX

[Day Off PDX](https://spk-project2.herokuapp.com/)

Day Off lets users find places in Portland to go to for recreation and exploration, aside from tourist attractions and the neverending lists of Yelp or Google searches. This app is most useful for locals who may be looking for new places to check out around town, or who keep meaning to go to certain place but never remember to, or just have some free time to explore the city. Users can add, edit, and delete locations (although deletion will be restricted to only users with proper authorization in the future, and edits will need to be approved). This app was built with Node.js, Mongoose, Express, React, and JSX and adheres to RESTful architecture and the MVC file structure.


Functionality to be added:
- Users and sessions
- Let users create their own lists
- Search by keyword, type, quadrant
- Restrict Edit and Delete to only users
- Responsive Design
- Show street address, website, admission if any
- Remove empty keyword elements
- Option to add infinite-ish keywords
